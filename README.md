# Teeko AI game Player

Developed an AI player for the Teeko board game using Python. The AI utilizes the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to optimize move decisions. A custom heuristic evaluation function was implemented to score game states, and predictive models were built to balance speed and accuracy, ensuring moves were made within a 5-second limit.


# Weather
This project is a Java program that sends a daily weather text message using the Twilio API.

The program uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specified location (in this case, "Madison"). It makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves the response, which is in JSON format. The program parses the JSON response to extract the temperature and weather description for the location.

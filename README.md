This project is a Java program that sends a daily weather text message using the Twilio API.

The program uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for a specified location (in this case, "Madison"). It makes an HTTP request to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieves the response, which is in JSON format. The program parses the JSON response to extract the temperature and weather description for the location.
